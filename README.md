# Lab_Assign7
For CS1
This program takes a dynamically allocated int array of user specific size and elements and preforms a bubble sort on it while keeping track of the number of swaps needed in each iteration of the sort. 

The program will ask the user the size of the array and what elements of the array and then output the iteration number and the number of swaps in that iteration. It does this up to the number of iterations needed for sort.
